### Hi there, good to see you here! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Remiel, a not-so-typical frontend manager. Yep, you heard it right. I've been working as Senior Frontend Developer for the last 8 years and got promoted as Senior Engineering Manager recently. My passion for coding is out of this world. I always keep myself informed about latest tech trends about frontend ecosystem, especially about React, Typescript, Next JS and many more. 

Whenever I'm not around the office, you can find me inside a basketball court or in a cafe nearby reading some good book. Recommend me some good ones and I'll give my regards straightaway :)
