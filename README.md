### Hi there, good to see you here! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Remiel, a somewhat unconventional frontend manager. Yes, you heard correctly. For the past eight years, I've been deeply entrenched in the role of a Senior Frontend Developer until my recent promotion to Senior Engineering Manager. My enthusiasm for coding knows no bounds, and I make it a point to stay abreast of the latest trends in the frontend ecosystem, particularly in React, TypeScript, Next.js, and beyond.

Outside of the office, you'll often find me either on the basketball court or nestled in a nearby cafÃ©, engrossed in a compelling book. If you have any recommendations, I'd be delighted to hear them, and I'll extend my gratitude promptly. :)
